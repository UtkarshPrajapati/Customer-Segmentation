1. Older Families (especially Budget and Premium) are highly valuable customers due to a combination of factors: larger household sizes,
higher  income, and potentially bulk purchasing habits.  They often have children and may be focused on grocery and household goods, which
contributes to higher overall spending.

2. New Families Spend Less Initially: "NEW FAMILIES" show the lowest spending overall. This is likely due to initial setup costs and
adjustments in spending habits as they welcome a new child. However, their spending could increase as their children grow older and their
financial situation stabilizes.
